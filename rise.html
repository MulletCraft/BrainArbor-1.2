    <h1>What was Mesopotamia?</h1>
    <p class="ancient"><b>Ancient Mesopotamia:</b> centered in present-day Iraq, occupies a unique place in the history of human culture. It is there, around 3400â€“3000 BC, that all the key elements of urban civilization first appear in one place: cities with monumental infrastructure and official bureaucracies overseeing agricultural, economic, and religious activities; the earliest known system of writing; and sophisticated architecture, arts, and technologies.</p>
    <h3>Impacts:</h3>
    <p class="meso"><b>Mesopotamia:</b> changed the nomadic way of life when it developed agriculture and domesticated animals. Agriculture allowed for a more stable food source that could also be stored in times when food was not readily available.</p>
